						<blockquote>
							<p>I had the pleasure of working with Darren at Zip Co Ltd. for approx. 2.5 years, firstly in his position as Head of the Sales Engineering team and later as the Head of Growth Projects.</p>
							<p>During this time I worked with Darren on multiple projects including RFP &amp; tender processes, third-party system integrations and on out-of-the-box product/tech innovation projects (sometimes even just for fun :)).</p>
							<p>Darren brings an enthusiasm with him to work everyday, influencing those around him to lift their game. He is well-versed in both the technical and non-technical aspects of eCommerce/payments integration and project management, often running projects that involved a high degree of coordination between multiple parties. He is a logical and pragmatic thinker, with meticulous attention to detail in all that he does.</p>
							<p>I recommend Darren and look forward to one day working with him again.</p>

							<p>I've had the pleasure of working with Darren for over 2 years in the Sales Engineering team and other areas at Zip.</p>

						<h4><strong>(2019) David Alsh - </strong> <em>Senior Software Engineer @ Rockt</em></h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>I worked alongside Darren in the recently held internal Zip Hackathon competition.</p> 
							<p>As a developer, I was looking for a team/idea to contribute my skills towards. Darren conceived the idea of a marketplace which allowed Zip customers to spend their account balances on gift cards via the Zip Stores page.</p> 
							<p>From the onset, Darren presented a comprehensively planned concept. He had prepared a marketing pitch which included commercial projections and their material benefit for the organisation. Not only did I think it was a great idea with a lot of potential, but I was also extremely impressed by Darren’s preparedness.</p> 
							<p>Before long, we were pushing ahead with technological planning. Darren wasn’t shy to offer his opinion on the features he thought would perform well, and as a team, collaborated effectively to build a product that went on to win third place in the Hackathon - further going on to to be published as a customer facing product which is consistently placed amongst our top merchants.</p> 
							<p>During the project development, I personally witnessed Darren bring an inspiring level of passion to the team. Maintaining an encouraging attitude throughout, while working diligently on improving the final marketing pitch with additional slides, animations and rehearsed lines.</p> 
							<p>Outside of the Hackathon, I have observed Darren bring that same positive and enthusiastic attitude to his daily work - continuing to inspire and encourage team members around him. I highly recommend Darren, a positive visionary that will continue to define the digital landscape with his brilliant ideas and natural leadership qualities.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>It was an absolute pleasure to work alongside Darren in the integrations team at ZIP. And I'm forever grateful for his ability and attitude to share his knowledge of complex "tech terms" in an easily digestible format.</p> 
							<p>Darren worked hard at his day-to-day duties of helping merchants integrate with Zip, and had many wins to show for it. Always there to go above & beyond his actual role -successfully developing leading and essential processes required for the functions of the enterprise integrations team.</p> 
							<p>Whilst primarily performing integrations for clients in-house, he was always whipping up exceptional enterprise tech props and presentations - and there to to assist our BDMs out in the field - pitching the technical aspects of Zip.</p> 
							<p>It was an absolute privilege to be part of his team, always inspiring us all - and never failing to put client needs first. He's a rare find of the kind. And it's glaringly clear how appreciated is - wherever he is.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>I worked with Darren in my position as business analyst at Graysonline.</p> 
							<p>Darren was both a colleague and my direct manager in my time at Grays. Darren was an extremely intelligent, hard working and positive colleague who drove the success of the digital development stream at Grays during my time there. He was extremely knowledgeable about many areas related to digital ecommerce, agile web development and had a great interest in all areas of technology in general.</p> 
							<p>Even though Darren only had a few years experience in IT due to his intelligence and hard work he quickly moved up in seniority within the organisation and ended up managing the digital team completely.</p> 
							<p>Darren was also a positive, cheerful colleague who on a personal level was a pleasure to work with both as a colleague and a manager. Since leaving Grays I have sought opportunities where I can work with Darren again and would recommend him as a valuable asset to any kind of digital business.</p>

							<p>I recently has occasion to work quite closely with Darren Smith who was organising an auction of surplus materials on behalf of Parramatta City Council.</p>
							<p>Darren is a very presentable and enthusiastic person who would be an asset for whomever he works. He organised the cataloguing, advertising and sale of a large number of goods and chattels on behalf of Council with efficiency and professionalism.</p>
							<p>He communicated clearly with a wide range of people including Council officers, tenants and members of the public and he made himself available for consultation throughout the entire process. I feel that his work was the key to the auction's success.</p>
							<p>I have no hesitation in recommending Darren to you as a conscientious, dedicated and enthusiastic person with strong communications and organisational skills, who represents his employer with a high level of professionalism.</p>
