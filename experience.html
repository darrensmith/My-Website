							<p>2. Re-engineered the team’s responsibilities and process from one where most integrations were done directly by the team (for smaller merchants) to one where we took on pre-sales consultative responsibilities for larger enterprise and channel merchants. To support this, I built out professional-looking pre-sales artefacts – such as technical proposals and technical pre-sales presentations, that went on to be used in the day to day duties of all team members</p>
